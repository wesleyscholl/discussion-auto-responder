## About

Discussion Autoresponder allows you to automatically create comments on new GitHub Discussions with a GitHub Action. This could be used to post a welcome comment, a message for responding back soon, and other use cases. 

##

## Usage

In your workflow, to create a new discussion autoresponder for new discussion topics, include a step like this:


```yaml
- name: Run discussion-auto-responder
  uses: wesleyscholl/discussion-auto-responder@v1.0.x
  id: autoresponder-comment
  with:
   GITHUB_TOKEN: "${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }}" # Required, the minimum required: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"  
   comment_body: "This comment was generated by the Discussion Autoresponder GitHub Action." # Also optional, this is the default message.          
       
```
##

## Requirements

To run this action, the Action Workflow permissions require read and write permissions in the repository for all scopes. 

- To configure this, go to:

**-> Repository Settings
-> Actions
-> General
-> Workflow Permissions**

- Then select: "Read and write permissions - Workflows have read and write permissions in the repository for all scopes."
- Finally click the save button.

## Action Inputs

| Name | Description | Requried? | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | A GitHub PAT is required, but the default is sufficient for public repos. For private repos, ensure you create a PAT that has `discussion: write` and `repo: write`, then store it as an action secret for usage within the workflow. See more details about tokens here. [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). | **Yes** | `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` | 
| `comment_body` | The contents of the autoresponder comment in string format. | **No** | `"This comment was generated by the Discussion Autoresponder GitHub Action."` |
| `delay_seconds` | Amount of delay time before the autoresponder comment is posted. Written in milliseconds (ms) | **No** | `1500` |

##

## Action Outputs

| Name | Description | How To Access |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `discussionId` | The node id of the discussion where the autoresponder comment was posted. | `${{ steps.<your-step>.outputs.discussionId }}` |
| `commentId` | The comment id posted in the discussion. | `${{ steps.<your-step>.outputs.commentId }}` |
| `commentBody` | The body of the comment posted. | `${{ steps.<your-step>.outputs.commentBody }}` |
